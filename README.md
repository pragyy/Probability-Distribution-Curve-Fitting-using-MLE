# Probability-Distribution-Curve-Fitting-using-MLE
This project provides a simple demonstration of how Maximum Likelihood Estimate technique can be used to estimate the optimal parameters for a probability distribution.

The dataset used in this project can be downloaded directly from this repository or it can be downloaded from the official source [here](https://www.quandl.com/data/OPEC/ORB-OPEC-Crude-Oil-Price).

Note - The dataset is constantly updated from the official source. The version I used for this forecasting had values recorded from the date 2014-10-29 to 2019-10-29.

Kindly open the .ipynb file in this repository for a detailed step by step explanation of all the operations performed on this time series dataset.
